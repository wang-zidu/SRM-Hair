 This repository is the official implementation of SRM-Hair. We propose SRM-Hair to advance head mesh reconstruction with a dataset of over 250 high-fidelity real hair mesh scans paired with 3D face data, along with a novel method for reconstructing a 3D head mesh with independent hair region from a single image using semantic-consistent ray modeling for 3D morphable hair.

 Coming soon (Paper is under review).
